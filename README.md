## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Worked with different data sets to find trends in differnt campaigns, outcomes on launch dates, goal and pledge amounts.
Based on the analysis it was found that Theater/Plays campaigns are the most successfull in the U. The best launch dates are in May and June. The Goal amount for the campaign should be around $3500 and it will be expected to meet your goal amount.
