# Kickstarter-analysis Test
## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Worked with different data sets to find trends in differnt campaigns, outcomes on launch dates, goal and pledge amounts.
Based on the analysis it was found that Theater/Plays campaigns are the most successfull in the US, this can be observed in the Parent Category and Subcategory. Outcomes charts and Theather subcategory Outcomes chart. The best launch dates for successful campaigns are in May and June and this can be seen in the Outbomes based on Launch date graph. Based on the descriptive statistics performed in the Goal and Pledge data for the Successful and Failed Plays, the Goal amount for the play campaign should be around $3500 and it will be expected to meet that goal amount before the end of the campaing.
